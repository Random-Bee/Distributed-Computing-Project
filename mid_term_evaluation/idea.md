# What is Distributed Hashing?

**Distributed Hashing** is a technique used to distribute the keys of a hash table across multiple nodes in a network.

## Why is Distributed Hashing used?

Distributed Hashing is used to provide a scalable and fault-tolerant way of storing and retrieving data in a distributed system. It is used to distribute the keys of a hash table across multiple nodes in a network.

## Which are the different types of Distributed Hash Tables?

There are different types of Distributed Hash Tables. Some of the most popular ones are:

1. Chord Distributed Hash Table (CDHT)
2. Kademlia Distributed Hash Table (KDHT)
3. Pastry Distributed Hash Table (PDHT)

## Focus of the Project

We will be mainly comparing Kademlia and Pastry Distributed Hash Tables. 

We will be implementing both the DHTs and comparing their performance in terms of latency, throughput, and fault tolerance.
